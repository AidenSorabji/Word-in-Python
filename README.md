# Is it Python 2 compatable?
No. This code is strickly Python 3 compatable, and only Python 3 compatable.

# Use
This is a open-source project. You are able to use it whenever you want, but you **must** give me credit. You can credit my discord, Github account, Youtube, etc etc as long as it is to one of my accounts.

# Problems
Please tell me if their are errors and problems (and why!), this will help me make the code much better than it was before and make it better for everyone else, including you!
